Quilt4Net-client-net
====================

.NET client part for Quilt4Net server

The server part is located here.
https://www.quilt4net.com/

You need to register to get your ClientToken. All issues captured and sent can be read and analyzed on the site.

I have been considering putting the server part on GitHub as well if there is enough requests for that.
